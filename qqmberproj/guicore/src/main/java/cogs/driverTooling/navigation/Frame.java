 * framenavigation is difficult as webdriver is document based, i.e. if it is on a specific document, it will consider that all there is. This works fine if you page is equal to your doc.
 * However, for frames it is a different matter. if on a frame, webdriver needs to be able to know about other frames in order to navigate there.
